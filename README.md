# healthcare-education-expenditure-analysis
A data visualization project using Google Visualization API tools 

For my midterm in the Introduction to Data Mining Class, I had to analyze the Military Spending of countries across the world.

The objectives of this project were as follows -

•	The educational and healthcare spending of at least the top 10 nations 
•	Compare this data to that country’s GDP 
•	Compare this data to the overall military spending of the country
•	Compare this per person educational spending to the per person GDP
•	Compare this per person healthcare spending to the per person GDP
•	Single out the fastest growing countries in healthcare and educational spending in fixed value and in percentage
